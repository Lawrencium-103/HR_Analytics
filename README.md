****Project Introduction: HR Insights with Power BI****


Welcome to the HR Dashboard project! I absolutely love this project because it's all about gaining deep insights into our organization's workforce using the powerful tool, Power BI.

* Why I Love It: This project is a gem because it allows us to uncover critical information about our workforce in a visually appealing and easily understandable way. I get to dive into the data and bring out insights that can be used for better decision-making.

* Project Outcome: With the HR Dashboard, I've achieved remarkable outcomes. I've successfully created a comprehensive view of our workforce, highlighting key statistics such as the total number of employees, gender distribution, promotion eligibility, service years, job levels, and even distance status. This information is invaluable for HR planning and management.


****Here are the measures created with Data Analysis Expression (DAX) in Power BIand and insights highlighted in the HR Dashboard project:****

* Total Employee: This measure provides an overview of the total number of employees in the organization, which stands at 1,470.

* Gender Distribution: The dashboard breaks down the workforce by gender, showing 60% male employees and 40% female employees.

* Promotion Eligibility: It identifies employees who are due for promotion, which is 4.90% of the total workforce. The remaining 95.10% are not due for promotion.

* Total Employees by Service Year: This measure categorizes employees by the number of years they've served in the organization. It offers insights into the distribution of service years.

* Total Employees by Job Level: This measure provides a breakdown of employees by job level, indicating the number of employees in each level.

* In-Service vs. To Be Retrenched: It categorizes employees into those currently in service (92%) and those slated to be retrenched (8%).

* Distance Status: This metric classifies employees based on their proximity to the organization, categorizing them as "Very Close," "Nearer," or "Very Far."

****The best part is that the skills I've acquired from this project are highly transferable. I can replicate this approach for new projects, whether it's analyzing data in a different department or exploring trends in entirely different industries. The power of data and Power BI is limitless, and I'm excited to keep using it to unlock insights wherever I go.****
